What does the recognizer do? 

The $P recognizer is a point-based recognizer that is used to detect single and 
multi stroke gestures for rapidly prototyping interfaces in a fast, low-cost and
accurate way.

Name an advantage of the $P recognizer over the $1 recognizer.

One advantage is that the $P can recognize both unistroke and multistroke gestures 
by representing gestures as “clouds of Points” so that the stroke order and 
direction of the user input can be ignored
whereas the $1 recognizer can only identify unistroke gestures.

What is the minimum matching distance?

The minimum matching distance (“goodness”) is the match between two point clouds - the
candidate gesture to the point cloud of the template from all n! possible alignments.
The template that has the smallest distance (sum of the Euclidean distances for all pairs of points)
from the candidate gesture is the classification result (the recognized gesture).
